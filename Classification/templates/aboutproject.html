        <h1>About Classage</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Classage</strong> is a simulation tool that mimics the behavior of an image classifier. 
            Instead of actually performing real-time machine learning, Classage demonstrates the typical workflow 
            of image classification to help users understand how these systems function conceptually.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is designed for educational and demonstrative purposes â€” perfect for students, teachers, or 
            anyone curious about how images are classified in AI systems, without needing the complex backend of real models.

            <h2>Why Classage?</h2>
            <p>
                Classage was created to provide an interactive and visual way to explore the concept of image classification 
                without diving deep into code or machine learning models. It simplifies the learning curve and encourages 
                experimentation.
